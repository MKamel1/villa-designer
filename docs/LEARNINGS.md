# Reusable engineering lessons

This index records observed behavior and its consequence. It is not a
source of architectural standards. The cited rule catalogue and decision
records remain authoritative for design guidance.

| Area | Observed behavior | Required consequence / evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Revit runner | A relative script path can exit zero without executing; model argument can leave no open document | Absolute paths, explicit document resolution, fresh artifact checks. `extract_model.resolve_doc`, `run_bedroom.run` |
| Revit 2027 | Family symbols load inactive; inactive placement raises; Name property can be ambiguous in IronPython | Activate, regenerate, use `Element.Name.GetValue`. `place_families_test.py`, committed fixture |
| Content | Template contains doors/windows although Libraries count suggests none; third-party categories and declared sizes are unreliable | Verify actual placed dimensions and bind by intent. Never substitute catalogue size for a measured family |
| Geometry | DirectShape rotation is baked; world bounding box is already rotated; family insertion point need not be footprint centre | Carry proxy direction, measured box centre and size. Quarter-turn reversal is exact; arbitrary rotation needs a local footprint. `from_extract.py`, regression tests |
| Review coverage | Dropping unknown chairs/tables makes clearances pass falsely | Keep every measurable piece as an obstacle, even without a published access figure |
| Accessory relationships | A desk chair occupies its desk's use zone; bedside tables intentionally occupy the bed's head-end zone | Explicit `accessory_to` intent is stored in Revit comments and disclosed in review. Exemption applies only to parent access; physical overlap and unrelated access still fail. It is a design interpretation, not an invented standard |
| Metadata | Falling back to Comments as an identity collides when comments contain shared structured metadata | Reserve `archpipe:` comments for intent; preserve Mark/ApplicationDataId as identity |
| Serialization | Revit `Color` channels are .NET bytes that IronPython's JSON encoder rejects | Convert to Python integers and serialize before opening the output, so failure cannot truncate the last extract |
| Scope | An isolated room is not a dwelling | Report unassessed dwelling rules and preserve their findings separately. Never quietly waive a missing bathroom in a full-house review |
| Native output | PDF export uses `PageOrientationType` and `ZoomType`; displayed headings do not prove a view's actual type | Verify native view types, scale, page count, vector geometry, and markup read-back; inspect pages |
| Native sheet layout | A blank sheet's content was off-centre and its viewport title overlapped the synthetic review note; long titles wrapped over the scale, despite passing vector-count checks | Create a native paper frame, reserve title spacing, use short display titles, and visually inspect exported pages. `revit/export_views.py` |
| Elevation direction | Revit's `ViewDirection` points toward the viewer, as documented in its installed application interface reference; a northward direction shows the south wall | Name interior elevations by the opposite direction and record the actual vector in the view report. Confirm the wall's openings/furniture visually |
| Markup text | Revit TextNote stores carriage-return line breaks and a trailing newline | Compare logical lines, preserving content; verify cloud vertices against chosen coordinates |
| Lighting ownership | Third-party families may override photometry even when writes appear successful | Join explicit spec photometry by model Mark, keep geometry from Revit, report unmatched identities. Never call the join wholly Revit-authored |
| Photometry | Blender IES azimuth differs, finite sphere sizing can wash out a strip light, coarse angular interpolation biases narrow beams | Keep calibrated orientation/size/angle corrections; see [decision 0010](decisions/ADR-0010-photometric-render-calibration.md) |
| Lighting claims | Direct calculations omit shadows and inter-reflection; an empty-room probe is calibration | Label the probe's contents. Do not claim furnished-room uniformity or real-world precision from it. [Decision 0009](decisions/ADR-0009-no-uniformity-verdict-from-direct-light.md) |
| Materials | Revit paint hue can be read; shading colour is not measured reflectance | Carry actual finish names/hues and separately disclose assumed optical values |
| Gates | A script printing FAIL but returning zero cannot gate a pipeline | Assert failed, missing and stale cases as well as passing cases; inspect saved evidence, not shell exit alone |
| Door handling | The current extract lacks actual hinge/facing handedness; the adapter uses the default left hinge | Native views show the authored door. Automated swing checks are provisional until handedness is extracted; do not claim general door-swing certification |
| MCP process input | On Windows with Python 3.14.7 and MCP library 1.30.0, a cached child inherited the live protocol input pipe and hung before creating its run lock; the same command completed directly | Give noninteractive children `stdin=subprocess.DEVNULL`. The real transport regression in `scripts/test_mcp.py --cached-run` verifies matching evidence first and requires a response within 30 seconds. Measured complete test: under two seconds |

## Update procedure

Workstation lessons measured on 2026-09-23:

| Area | Observed behavior | Reusable consequence / evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Probe placement | Three isolated timing trials gave graphics speed ratios of 1.98 for direct light and 7.08 for sixteen bounces; mean illuminance differed by less than 0.001 percent | Use graphics acceleration by default, retain processor comparison. `workstation.py benchmark`, [worker evidence](ops/workstation-jobs.md) |
| Reuse | Three unchanged camera jobs were all reused after unrelated documentation/orchestration changes; a modified cached artifact fails the hash check | Fingerprint job dependencies and actual runtime; verify artifacts, preserve failed attempts. `worker.cached_job`, `tests/test_worker.py` |
| Candidate interpretation | Both negative bed shifts failed design review while the worker batch completed successfully | Report execution success separately from design acceptance; never apply candidate geometry to a saved extract. `worker_entry.py` sweep |
| Portable verification | Installed native Revit family corpus is unavailable on Ubuntu and its transfer was not authorized | Keep live corpus checks on Windows; explicitly report skipped coverage and run synthetic parser cases remotely. `verify.py --portable`, `tests/test_rfa_portable.py` |
| Headless Radiance build | The full CMake build attempted OpenGL targets even with headless mode enabled | Build the twelve required command-line targets from the checksum-pinned official source; record the installed subset. `ops/workstation/bootstrap.py` |
| Worker contention | Render and probe jobs share one graphics processor | Use an operating-system lock across worker processes and bounded processor jobs; benchmark in isolation. `worker.process_lock`, `worker_entry.py` |
| External implementation | Claude Code's actual session identified `claude-sonnet-5`; broad scientific work required substantial research before writing code | Pin and verify the model; provide narrow ownership, bounded effort and existing evidence. The lead retains actual integration checks. [Delegation workflow](ops/delegated-implementation.md) |
| Native fixture geometry | Fine extraction exposed a 1,828.8 mm housing across the west wall and 2,624-triangle light-source display webs below each cylinder pendant | Check actual housing bounds and rotate the long fitting along the wall. Preserve `Light Source` subcategory geometry with an explicit symbolic role and exclude those display webs from physical rendering. `probe_fixture_geometry.py`, extractor, round-trip gate |
| Procedural solids | A closed, consistently connected headboard mesh still had inward-facing triangles because its two-dimensional profile walked clockwise | Test positive signed volume independently of paired edges; reverse the profile before extrusion. `tests/test_furniture.py` caught the error before final acceptance |
| Radiance tool contracts | Portable mocks accepted the wrong output-directory flag and a split format flag; the actual toolchain exposed them | Use absolute per-job `ies2rad -o` prefixes, `RAYPATH` for support files, joined `rtrace -faa`, separate diagnostic output, and actual source/sky checks. `tests/test_radiance.py` |
| Window simulation | An extracted glass solid has front and back faces; giving both a whole-window transmittance applies it twice | Use one planar surface from the actual glazing mesh, keep actual opaque frames, and state the optical assumption. `radiance._glazing_surface` regression |

For a new failure, capture the input and expected versus measured result;
separate hypotheses from facts. Add a regression where it can catch the
same failure. Record the version/environment and link the owning code or
fixture here. Change a skill only when the lesson changes how the workflow
should be run. Change an agent role only when its responsibility changes.
Change an MCP tool when the reusable operation or its contract changes.

This is an explicit maintenance loop, not autonomous model training:
observed failure, regression, reusable fix, shared lesson, affected workflow.

Do not copy bedroom coordinates, permissive example scope, or proxy
fallbacks into universal villa rules. A later real-site result must not
inherit the example's assumptions unnoticed.
